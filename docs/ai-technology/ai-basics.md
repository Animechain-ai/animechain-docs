We will provide an overview of the fundamental mechanisms of image/video generative AI and recent technological advancements, highlighting how AI technology is being applied to anime production.

Image/video generative AI fundamentally learns from large datasets to generate new images or videos. In animation, it is employed to create various elements such as character designs, backgrounds, and artwork.

Recent technological advancements have significantly improved generative AI's performance, enabling the rapid generation of high-quality images and videos. This increased efficiency has benefited various stages of anime production.

Moreover, generative AI technology reduces manual labor in existing anime production processes, alleviating the burden on creators and allowing them to focus on more creative tasks.

## Diffusion Models

Diffusion models play an important role in image generation. Their basic mechanism involves gradually refining images containing noise to produce high-quality results.

These models are characterized by their stability and accuracy. In the context of anime image generation, the ability to faithfully reproduce detailed character expressions and background textures is essential. Animechain.ai is developing diffusion models specifically optimized for anime image generation, leveraging these strengths to achieve high-quality results.


## Fine-Tuning and Merging AI Models

In image generative AI, fine-tuning is the process of optimizing a model's performance to align with specific styles or themes. Animechain.ai fine-tunes models to match anime-specific styles and expressions.

A common fine-tuning method is fine adjustment, which involves using a small amount of data to adapt an existing model without significantly altering its overall structure. This allows for customization to specific needs. Another approach is model merging, which combines multiple models with diverse characteristics to create a single, high-performance model capable of broader and more nuanced expressions, expanding the range of anime production possibilities.


## Multimodal Generative Models

Multimodal generative models can generate content by combining different modalities such as text, audio, and video. This enables the integrated generation of multiple elements in anime production, such as automatic story generation, character actions, and scene sound effects.

Animechain.ai leverages multimodal generative models to automate various stages of anime production, aiming to shorten production time, improve quality, and enhance creators' creativity.
