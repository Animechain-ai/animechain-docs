## Current Challenges in Anime Generative AI

While generative AI significantly contributes to improving efficiency and quality in anime production, it currently faces several challenges.


### Copyright Issues with Training Data: 

Current generative AI systems learn from vast amounts of data collected from the internet, much of which may be copyrighted or licensed. Using unauthorized data without permission poses legal risks of copyright infringement. Furthermore, most mainstream generative AI systems do not compensate creators and artists who provided the training data.


### Lack of Quality and Consistency in Generated Content: 

Current generative AI often struggles to consistently generate specific styles or maintain quality. Anime characters and background art require consistent visual styles throughout a work, but achieving this with AI requires advanced fine-tuning. Additionally, the quality of generated animations can vary between frames.


### Difficulties in Collaboration Between Creators and AI: 

AI tools often require specialized knowledge to operate and customize results, making them inaccessible to many creators. This hinders the full utilization of creators' creativity. Moreover, there is a lack of intuitive interfaces for effective creator-AI interaction.


### Challenges in Sustainable Development of AI Models: 

Training advanced generative AI models demands substantial computational resources and time, making the rapid introduction of new technologies and models difficult. Continuous data collection and model updates are necessary to maintain AI performance, but efficiently learning while ensuring data quality and quantity remains a challenge.

To address these challenges, it is crucial to prioritize transparency in data collection and usage, build a system that respects creators' rights, and improve the quality and consistency of generative AI outputs. Additionally, developing user-friendly tools and interfaces is essential for broader adoption and creative empowerment. Animechain.ai aims to tackle these challenges through innovative solutions.


## Traceability of Training Data

Animechain.ai uses blockchain technology to manage the entire process from data collection to usage in a transparent and tamper-resistant manner. All training data is assigned a unique identifier (ID) at the time of collection, and this ID is recorded on the blockchain. This makes it possible to track the source and usage history of the data, enabling verification of the data collection process and usage status.

By making the transaction history and usage status of training data verifiable by anyone, data providers and users can always check the status of data usage, increasing the reliability of the entire system. Furthermore, the distributed ledger technology of blockchain makes it extremely difficult to tamper with data once recorded. This ensures the accuracy and integrity of the data, guaranteeing the reliability of the training data.

Importantly, Animechain.ai's system only improves the traceability of data; the data itself is strictly confidential. Only the data ID is recorded on the blockchain, while the actual content such as images and videos is managed in a separate secure environment. This method ensures traceability and transparency of data while protecting creators' intellectual property rights and maintaining the security of confidential information.


## Ensuring Traceability of AI-Generated Products

The outputs generated by AI models are also assigned unique IDs, which are managed on the blockchain to ensure their traceability. The blockchain records only the ID of the output and minimal related information, making it clearly traceable to which model it was generated from. The actual output and its detailed metadata are managed in a separate secure system. This ensures the origin and quality of the outputs, allowing users to use them with confidence.

Furthermore, the IDs of rights information related to the outputs are also recorded on the blockchain, clarifying the rights owners and usage status. This reduces the risk of copyright infringement and unauthorized use, protecting creators' rights. By introducing a verification process for outputs, it is confirmed that generated animations and images are based on pre-authorized data, reducing the risk of copyright infringement.

This approach allows Animechain.ai to maintain data privacy and security while ensuring traceability and transparency, without directly handling sensitive data or large-volume content on the blockchain. This prevents unauthorized leakage of data and outputs, enhancing the safety and reliability of the system.


## Automating Rights Management with Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are programs that automatically execute rights processing when conditions are met. Animechain.ai aims to automate rights processing using these. When revenue is generated, it is automatically distributed to creators and rights holders through smart contracts, preventing delays and fraud.

Furthermore, by introducing a conditional rights transfer mechanism, rights can be set to transfer only when specific conditions are met. For example, it is possible to set rights to transfer only after a certain amount of revenue is generated. This ensures that rights are transferred only when specific achievements are made, maintaining transparency and fairness.

The execution guarantee of smart contracts eliminates human errors and interference, ensuring the fulfillment of contracts. With revenue distribution and rights transfers being executed reliably, creators and data providers can engage in transactions with peace of mind.


## Utilizing Traceability Information

By utilizing traceability information, Animechain.ai provides many benefits. First, reward distribution to data providers and creators is carried out transparently and accurately.

Next, by providing traceability information for AI model outputs, the reproducibility and accountability of models are ensured. This increases reliability for users and regulatory authorities, clearly demonstrating which data was used to train AI models, enhancing transparency.

Furthermore, data governance is strengthened through the analysis of traceability information. Effective strategies can be developed to ensure the quality and quantity of data, improving the learning efficiency of AI models. It becomes easier to evaluate the quality of collected data and track usage history, improving the accuracy of data management.

It also leads to improved reliability of outputs. By utilizing traceability information, the reliability and quality of generated animations and images are enhanced, providing reassurance to creators and users. Quality assurance and clarification of the origin of outputs create an environment where users can confidently use the works.

Finally, it becomes possible to develop new business models and revenue sources based on traceability information. For example, the creation of a data market utilizing traceability information or the sale of AI model licenses can be considered. This promotes the growth and development of the entire ecosystem.

In this way, Animechain.ai ensures data traceability using blockchain technology, enhances the reliability and transparency of AI models and outputs, and realizes appropriate reward distribution to creators and data providers. This is expected to promote the growth and development of the entire anime industry, allowing the entire ecosystem to evolve sustainably. Through these efforts, Animechain.ai will become an important element supporting the future of anime production and a valuable platform for all stakeholders, including creators, data providers, investors, and fans.
