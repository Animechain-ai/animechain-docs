In anime production, generative AI technology has the potential to revolutionize many processes, including character design, background art creation, and automatic generation of animation scenes. However, current generative AI technology faces challenges with inadequate rights clearance for data usage. Animechain.ai aims to address this issue by promoting generative AI technology that uses data with appropriate rights clearance. This approach seeks to minimize the risk of rights infringement while providing high-quality generative AI models.


## "Opt-in Data First" Principle: 

Animechain.ai's ultimate goal is to provide generative AI models that use only "opt-in data" with explicit permission from data owners. However, in the initial project stages, some use of opt-out data is anticipated, necessitating a phased approach. We will start by creating models that add rights-cleared data to existing opt-out datasets or building new base models that combine both, with the aim of transitioning to fully opt-in data as soon as possible.


## Provision of High-Quality Anime-Oriented Generative AI Models: 

Generative AI models trained on rights-cleared data, having learned anime-specific visuals and motions, will generate high-quality animations and character designs. This enables reductions in production time and costs. Specifically, generative AI can create character movements and expressions according to the creator's intentions, and with further modifications, significantly enhance the efficiency of the entire production process.

Intuitive Interface for AI Collaboration: 

Animechain.ai provides an intuitive interface for smoother collaboration between creators and generative AI. In addition to traditional text-based prompts, creators can provide more intuitive and direct instructions through sketches, 3D data, and a visual UI. This maximizes creators' creativity and enables seamless collaboration with AI.


## Ensuring Transparency and Reliability through Blockchain Technology: 

By recording data usage history and generation processes on the blockchain, transparency and reliability are ensured. Leveraging blockchain's inherent characteristics, all data transactions and generation processes are publicly available and verifiable. This allows creators and users to utilize generative AI technology with confidence.

Through these initiatives, Animechain.ai aims to provide high-quality anime generative AI technology and tools while resolving rights clearance issues. We strive to contribute to the development of the anime industry by protecting data owners' rights while fostering innovation.
